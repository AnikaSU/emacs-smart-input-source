* About
This package provide several modes to switch OS native input source smartly:

- A global mode: ~smart-input-source-global-auto-english-mode~ to automatically
  switch to English when leaving ~evil~ insert mode. It can also be used
  regardless the presence of ~evil~, to optionally switched to English
  immediately when the mode is turned on.
- A buffer local mode: ~smart-input-source-follow-context-mode~ to switch input
  source smarted according to context when entering ~evil~ insert mode. A
  function ~smart-input-source-follow-context~ is also provided to hook as your
  wish, regardless the presence of ~evil~.
- A buffer local mode: ~smart-input-source-inline-english-mode~ to enable the
  automatic triggerring of a temporary overlay to input English and then back to
  none-English without switching input sources manually.

* Features
1. Use OS native input source, no need to change use experience.
2. Support GUI Emacs, as well as Terminial Emacs.
3. Easy to install and config. No further config for ~GUI Emacs Mac Port~ with
   ~Sogou Input~.
4. Respect ~Evil~ (also works without evil):
   1) When leave ~insert~ mode, switch to English input source automatically.
   2) when enter ~insert~ model, switch input source automatically according to
      context.
5. Support ~inline English~ region:
   1) Inserting space around none-English characters triggers the region. Before
      inserting, current position can have zero or more spaces to the
      none-English character.
   2) In this mode, Engligh will be sticked.
   3) Region is closed when cursor leaves the region or ~Return~ is pressed.
   4) If the region ends with space, none-English input source will be
      selected, or English input source is retained.
   5) After the close of the region, one space in the head and one space in the
      tail (if exists) of the region will be deleted.
6. Switch input source according to context: When entering ~evil~ insert mode,
   input source will be determined according to the context.
7. Input source switching rules are designed carefully, for pure English
   editing, input source will never be switched to other languages.

* Features (Chinese)
1. 使用操作系统的输入法，不改变使用习惯。
2. 支持 GUI Emacs, 也支持 Terminal Emacs.
3. 安装配置简单， GUI Emacs Mac Port 下使用搜狗拼音免配置。
4. 如果在 Evil 下（没有 evil 也可以正常工作）:
   1) 从 insert 模式离开时，自动切换到英文输入法。
   2) 进入 insert 模式时, 根据上下文自动切换输入法。
5. 支持 inline English 区域：
   1) 在汉字前后插入空格触发 inline English 区域。插入之前，当前位置与汉字之间可以有空格。
   2) 在 inline English 下，一直使用英文输入法。
   3) 光标离开区域，或者回车，关闭 inline English 区域。
   4) 区域如果是空格结尾，输入法切回非其它语言，否则输入法保持英文。
   5) 区域关闭后，首尾各删除一个空格（如果有的话）。
6. 根据上下文切换输入法：当进入 ~evil~ 的 insert 模式时，根据上下文确定输入法。
7. 可以安全地默认开启mode：编辑英文时，输入法永远不会自动切换到其它语言。

* Install
Just install this package from ~melpa~, and then install *input source manager*
by any of the following ways:
- On MacOS, use GUI Emacs Mac Port (EMP), no need to configure input source
  manager. You can install ~EMP~ by the following commands:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
  brew install emacs-mac --with-modules --with-rsvg --with-imagemagick --with-natural-title-bar
  #+END_SRC
- On MacOS, use Emacs other than GUI EMP, with ~macism~, no need to configure
  input source manager. You can install ~macism~ by the following commands:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  brew tap laishulu/macism
  brew install macism
  #+END_SRC
  Note: The first time when you use ~macism SOME_INPUT_SOURCE_ID~ in your app,
  MacOS will popup a window asking you to grant permission of Accessibility, you
  can also grant the permission manually following the instructions in [[https://github.com/laishulu/macism/][macism]].

  If you have problems on granting permission of Accessibility for Emacs, see
  below:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Some Emacs "distributions" package together a number of Emacs binaries for
  various macOS versions in a single folder, and dynamically at runtime chooses
  the right one for your system. This means that the icon you click to start the
  program is really a "placeholder" that is not Emacs itself, but rather just
  starts up Emacs. This "placeholder" often takes the form of a Ruby script. If
  this is the case, you'll need to drag the Ruby program on to the list. Ruby
  comes with macOS by default. You can find the program by opening Finder, and
  then from the "Go" menu choose "Go to Folder". Enter "/usr/bin" and you'll get
  that folder opened in Finder. In the folder, you'll find the ruby program that
  you can drag on to the Accessibility list.
  #+END_QUOTE
- Any other case (eg. on Linux or Windows), input source manager should be
  configured:
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (setq smart-input-source-external-ism "YOUR_ISM")
  #+END_SRC

  If ~YOUR_ISM~ *CAN'T* be used in the following way:
  + Run ~YOUR_ISM~ will output the current input source
  + Run ~YOUR_ISM INPUT_SOURCE_ID~ will select ~INPUT_SOURCE_ID~.

  you should also configure the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (setq smart-input-source-do-get-input-source
        #'YOUR_DO_GET_INPUT_SOURCE_FUNCTION)
  (setq smart-input-source-do-set-input-source
        #'YOUR_DO_SET_INPUT_SOURCE_FUNCTION)
  #+END_SRC
  Refer to the section of /Configurations for other input source managers/
  at the end of this documentation.
 
* Usage
The mode is designed carefully, so it's safe to enable for all buffers even
its all in English.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(use-package smart-input-source
  :config
  (setq smart-input-source-english-input-source
        "com.apple.keylayout.US")
  (setq smart-input-source-other-input-source
        "com.sogou.inputmethod.sogou.pinyin")
  (smart-input-source-global-auto-english-mode t)
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'smart-input-source-follow-context-mode)
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'smart-input-source-follow-context-mode)
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'smart-input-source-inline-english-mode)
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'smart-input-source-inline-english-mode))
#+END_SRC

**  How to get the input source id
After /input source manager/ is configured, you can get your /current
input source id/ by runing the following command in Emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(smart-input-source--get-input-source)
#+END_SRC

* Configurations for other input source managers
** Example: ~fcitx~
~fcitx~ is a input method framework popular among Chinese Linux users.
~fcitx-remote~ can serve as an input source manager for `fcitx`, and you can
configure as following:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'subr-x)
(setq smart-input-source-external-ism "fcitx-remote")
(setq smart-input-source-english-input-source "1")
(setq smart-input-source-other-input-source "2")
(setq smart-input-source-do-get-input-source
      (lambda()
        (string-trim
         (shell-command-to-string
          smart-input-source-external-ism))))
(setq smart-input-source-do-set-input-source
      (lambda(source)
        (pcase source
          ("1" (string-trim (shell-command-to-string
                             (concat smart-input-source-external-ism " -c"))))
          ("2" (string-trim (shell-command-to-string
                             (concat smart-input-source-external-ism " -o")))))))
#+END_SRC

** Example: ~ibus~
~ibus~ is another popular input method framework in the Linux world.
You can configure as following:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'subr-x)
(setq smart-input-source-external-ism "ibus")
(setq smart-input-source-english-input-source "xkb:us::eng")
(setq smart-input-source-other-input-source "OTHER_INPUT_SOURCE")
(setq smart-input-source-do-get-input-source
      (lambda()
        (string-trim (shell-command-to-string
          (concat smart-input-source-external-ism " engine")))))
(setq smart-input-source-do-set-input-source
      (lambda(source)
        (string-trim (shell-command-to-string
          (concat smart-input-source-external-ism " engine " source)))))
#+END_SRC

** Example: ~im-select~
[[https://github.com/daipeihust/im-select][im-select]] can be used as input source manager in Microsoft Windows.
It fulfills the requirements as a drop-in replacement of ~macism~, thus its
configuration is simpler than other input source managers.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq smart-input-source-external-ism "im-select.exe")
(setq smart-input-source-english-input-source "ENGLISH_INPUT_SOURCE")
(setq smart-input-source-other-input-source "OTHER_INPUT_SOURCE")
#+END_SRC

However, because even though ~im-select~ supports switching different input
languages, it does not support multiple input methods in the same lanuage,
thus you should ensure that in each input language there is only one input
method, just like the following screenshot.
