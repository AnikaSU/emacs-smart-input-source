** When to switch input source
- Enter insert mode: select input source smartly by inspect the context.
- Leave insert mode: select english input source
- Input a character: select input source smartly by inspect the context.
** How smart to select input source by context
Denote character of other language as ~A~, english character as ~a~, and ~^~ as cursor.

- Same line rules:
  - ~A ^~ and ~^ A~ will change to ENGLISH.
  - ~A^~ and ~^A~ will change to OTHER.
  - ~a^~ and ~^a~ will change to ENGLISH.
- Across line rules:
  - ~A\n^~ will change to OTHER.
  - ~a\n^~ will change to ENGLISH.
** How the input source is switched
- For GUI session of ~emacs mac port~, use native API for better performance.
- If ~emacs mac port~ is unavailable, or in terminal session, use ~macism~ or
  other compatible CLI tool.
- If even ~macism~ like tool is unailable, then do nothing.
* Use other input source manager
If you don't use ~macos~, your should install other compatible tool:
  - For tool fulfills the following requirements, you can just:
    ~(setq evil-smart-input-source-external-ism TOOL_PATH)~
    - Run ~tool~ will output the current input source
    - Run ~tool SOME_INPUT_SOURCE_ID~ will select to ~SOME_INPUT_SOURCE_ID~.
  - For other tool, customize the following variables:
    - ~evil-smart-input-source-do-get-input-source~
    - ~evil-smart-input-source-do-set-input-source~
